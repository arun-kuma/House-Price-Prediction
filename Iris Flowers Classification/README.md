# Iris Flowers Classification
## Dataset:
  ### The dataset contains the different aspects that are taken into account for the determination of the type of iris flower.The independent features in the dataset are Sepal Length, Sepal Width , Petal Length and Petal Width.The dependent variable is the Species to which the Iris flower belongs to.
## Training Model:
  ### The Machine Learning Model that was used to train the model is SVM(Support Vector Machine) which is used to classify data by finding the optimal decision boundary that maximally separates different classes.
## Feature Scaling:
  ### It is applied to the training set to normalize the values of the dataset into a particular range(-1 to 1)
