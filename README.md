# House-Price-Prediction
## Dataset:
  ### The dataset contains the different aspects or features of the houses that are required for the prediction of the price of the house. The independent features that are enlisted were area,bedrooms,bathrooms,stories,mainroad,guestroom,basement,hotwaterheater,airconditioning,parking,prefarea and furnishing status. The dependent variable is price which will be predicted using the independent features.
  
## Training Model:
  ### The machine learning model that was used for the training is multiple linear regression which will take multiple independent features to predict the dependent approximated value.
  
## OneHotEncoding:
  ### The onehotencoding is applied for the categorical data so that the model can predict data efficiently. For example, for the furnishing status feature the onehotencoding is applied to make the strings or categorical data into machine understandable integers.
## Label Encoding:
 ### Label encoding is similar to onehotencoding but instead it gives out the numbers interms of ranks.
